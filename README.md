# classifier_notebooks

Hello! This is a part of our capstone project, myChess.
Our aim was to create an accessible platform to play chess against an AlphaZero style engine and also to attempt to classify playstyles based on some statistics from game data.

There's a lot of work still to be done but the results seem promising so far!
